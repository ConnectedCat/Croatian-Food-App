Seams like you did not use the latest files I have sent you - I am attaching them both again. Don't freak out - they are not totally different - here are the things that need to be updated:
~intro text in croatian
		DONE
~whole croatian version (questions) are coming up in english
		DONE
~question two - both in english and croatian - cheese needs to move in front of the white text box
		DONE
~fruit question - positioning changed + replace the fig (it is pixelated)
		DONE
~desserts images changed (replace the pudding with the one from the attached file as well)
		DONE
		
Other than that these are some details that are showing up wrong:
~first page - both logos should be the link as well (not just words english/hrvatski).
		DONE 
~hover stage should be red (we would like the words english/hrvatski to change color when hovering both the words or the logos)
		DONE
~the words english/hrvatski and all the bold fonts in questions look weird - they are too spaced out - please make sure the are set at 30/33pt, Optical (this is very important), kerning=10 (not sure how this is set in the code - letter spacing?)
		Points don't exist on the screen media, I have them set as follows now: font: 30px/33px 'Code Pro Bold LC', sans-serif !important; letter-spacing: 2px; If it does seem right set the values in a developer panel to the right values and I'll update the CSS.
		
~the content is moving around the page too much - how we had it set in photoshop is that it visually always sits in the middle of the page, the answers are aligned center on top pf the "next" button+arrow. If you need page to page info of what to move where I can write it out for you, but you might just take a better look at positioning in the psd file..
		In progress
~there is some sort of a bug when I switch between the questions - every time I hit next the content first flies up before it is placed in the middle of the page - this takes a second but it should be fixed..
		In progress
~the selected stage buttons should be black&white/grey, not blue if possible
		In progress 
~thanks for adding "please select the answer" but lets change it so it is Helvetica bold, 14pt, always one line & same position (see attached image)
		Set to 14px, let me know if you want to change this
		
		
		
GENERAL
-can you make the selection buttons smaller (I actually liked the ones you put in first better, but if they could be black&white)

-on all the pages the pattern on the bottom has a tiny hairline far down that shouldn't be there - could you please take out?
DONE
-please reduce the line height  of h1 on the intro page and move the whole text a bit up so its visually centered on the page
DONE - line-height: 37px; top: -30px;

ENGL VERSION
-move the vine content a bit up and right and make the white box behind the text smaller (there is more white space around the text then on other questions)

-Q12 make the white box a bit bigger on the top (give a bit more room around the text)
DONE
-Q14 make the white box a bit smaller and move the whole thing a bit up and right
DONE
-Q15 make the white box a bit bigger all around and move the content a bit up
DONE

CRO VERSION
seams like you didn't adjust the column widths for croatian (you left it the same as in english)
-Q2 center the answers under the question and make the white box smaller on the right (you will need to move the pot image closer to the text)
DONE
-Q3 adjust the size of the white box on the left (you will need to move the mushroom image closer to the text)
DONE
-Q4 move the answers a bit to the left (center under the question)
DONE
-Q5 reduce the size of the white box a bit on the left and move the answers more to the right (center under the question)
DONE
-Q7 reduce the size of the white box (you will need to move the cow image a bit to the right)
DONE
-Q8 reduce the size of the white box and move the answers more to the right (center under the question)
DONE
-Q10 reduce the size of the white box and move the answers more to the right (you can leave the olives where they are)
DONE
-Q12 - this white box is too small (too close to the text) and the text should go into two lines - please refer back to the cro file I sent you with designs (also the last answer is running under the image but this will be fixed if you change the width of the column) you can also move the whole thing a bit up
DONE
-Q13 move the bottom left plate up (closer to the text) and move the whole thing a bit down
DONE
-Q14 make the white box around the text smaller and move the whole thing up and right
DONE
-Q15 make the white box around the text smaller on the left and bigger on the top
DONE
